## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript

### What I learned

I learnt a lot. What I learnt include

- How to build a project using Tailwind CSS
  - This was very interesting. I had waited a long time to witness the hype on Tailwind, only to find out that the hype worths it.
- How to build a Typescript project
  - This is a relatively small project, so I wasn't able to practice a lot of Typescript.
- How to Vite
  - Setting up the challenge with vite was quite challenging. I had to do a lot of reasearch and trial and error.
- Summary: I hahd a fun experience moving from the native HTML, vanilla CSS, and vanilla JS to a more advanced combination

### Continued development

I faced a lot of challenge with the folder structure. (I was looking for best practices. I didn't see any. I was disappointed.)

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com) - Their documentation was very easy to follow. I highly recommended if you're just learning Tailwind.
